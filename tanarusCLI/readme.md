# Tanarus
### CLI and GUI weather application for desktop

## Documentation
Tanarus is named after the god of thunder in Celtic mythology, Taranis.
Tanarus uses the Open-Meteo weather API by default. In the future, I would like to give users the ability to check multiple APIs at once, or to select their own preferred default API.
Open-Meteo's documentation can be found here: [insert a link]

### Usage
#### Installation
To install Open-Meteo, either use the Windows Installer found in the download links at the bottom of this documentation, or use the MacOS package installer also found below. If you'd prefer to use a package manager, you can use brew, yum, or apt-get (instructions in download section).
#### CLI Commands
Tanarus will show you all the available commands if you ask it nicely (typing `tanarus -help`). Below are the supported commands and their purposes.
